# System Security Foundations Lab (SSF-Lab) at UIUC
The System Security Foundations Lab (SSF-Lab) at UIUC conducts foundational research on the security, privacy, and trustworthiness of real-world systems. Our mission is to identify, reason about, and eliminate fundamental security design flaws—not just implementation bugs—in the systems, platforms, and standards that society depends on every day.

SSF-Lab focuses on security as a system-level design problem, combining rigorous formal methods with empirical system analysis to deliver provable security guarantees and deployable protections.
