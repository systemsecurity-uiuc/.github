# System Security Foundations Lab (SSF-Lab) at UIUC
The System Security Foundations Lab (SSF-Lab) at UIUC conducts foundational research on the security, privacy, and trustworthiness of real-world systems. Our mission is to identify, reason about, and eliminate fundamental security design flaws—not just implementation bugs—in the systems, platforms, and standards that society depends on every day.

SSF-Lab focuses on security as a system-level design problem, combining rigorous formal methods with empirical system analysis to deliver provable security guarantees and deployable protections.

## Research Focus

SSF-Lab studies security and privacy challenges across the full system stack, with an emphasis on design-level vulnerabilities and long-term architectural correctness:

- AI & Agentic Systems Security
Secure interoperability and policy enforcement for intelligent agents and multi-agent systems

- System & Platform Security
Operating systems, mobile platforms, browsers, and cloud infrastructures

- IoT & Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)
Smart home ecosystems, industrial IoT, and standardized IoT protocols (e.g., MQTT, Matter)

- Formal Methods for Security & Privacy
Formal modeling, verification, and compliance guarantees for complex systems

- Mobile & Cloud Security
Authentication, access control, data isolation, and cross-service interactions

- Software Supply Chain Security
SDKs, libraries, CI/CD pipelines, and ecosystem-scale risk propagation
